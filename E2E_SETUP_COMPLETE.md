# E2E Encrypted Messaging Setup Complete ✅

Your Ilma system is now fully configured and ready for testing End-to-End encrypted messaging between teachers and administrators.

## 🎯 What Was Configured

### 1. **Enhanced Test Configuration** (`test_config.json`)

- **Teacher-Admin Direct Communication**: Dedicated thread with bidirectional messaging
- **Group Conversations**: Multi-participant threads including admin broadcasts
- **Encrypted Message Storage**: All messages include proper encrypted keys for recipients
- **Realistic Test Data**: 4 messages across 3 different thread scenarios

### 2. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`tests/message_e2e_tests.rs`)

- **Authentication Tests**: Verify both teacher and admin can login
- **Message Sending**: Test teacher sending encrypted messages to admin
- **Message Receiving**: Test admin reading and listing message threads
- **Reply Functionality**: Test admin sending encrypted replies back to teacher
- **Thread Management**: Verify conversation threading works correctly
- **Complete E2E Flow**: Full conversation simulation with multiple message exchanges

### 3. **Test Automation Scripts**

- **`run_message_tests.ps1`**: Automated test runner with progress indicators
- **`validate_config.ps1`**: Configuration validation and verification
- **`E2E_MESSAGING_GUIDE.md`**: Complete API documentation and examples

## 🚀 How to Test E2E Encrypted Messaging

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```powershell
# Run the complete test suite
.\run_message_tests.ps1
```

### Individual Test Components

```bash
# Test just the authentication
cargo test test_login_teacher_and_admin --test message_e2e_tests -- --nocapture

# Test complete conversation flow
cargo test test_complete_e2e_conversation --test message_e2e_tests -- --nocapture

# Run all message tests
cargo test --test message_e2e_tests -- --nocapture
```

### Manual API Testing

```bash
# Start the server
cargo run

# Then use the API endpoints documented in E2E_MESSAGING_GUIDE.md
```
