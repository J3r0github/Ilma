# Configloader Cleanup Fix Summary

## Problem

The configloader was hanging when cleaning up test data, causing the application to not terminate properly during shutdown.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Database Lock Contention**: Cleanup was running while the server was still active, causing table locks
2. **No Transaction Wrapping**: Each DELETE operation was separate, allowing for potential deadlocks
3. **No Timeout Protection**: Cleanup could hang indefinitely if database operations got stuck
4. **Race Condition**: Signal handler was calling cleanup before properly shutting down the server

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Transaction Wrapping (`src/configloader.rs`)

- Wrapped all cleanup operations in a single database transaction
- This prevents partial cleanups and reduces lock contention
- Added proper error handling with transaction rollback

### 2. Added Timeout Protection

- Implemented a 30-second timeout for the entire cleanup operation
- If cleanup hangs, it will abort and return an error instead of hanging forever
- Added detailed logging to track which step is taking time

### 3. Improved Shutdown Sequence (`src/main.rs`)

- Modified signal handlers to stop the server FIRST before cleanup
- Added a 500ms grace period for active requests to complete
- This prevents new requests from interfering with cleanup

### 4. Enhanced Logging

- Added detailed progress logging for each cleanup step
- Shows count of items being deleted for each table
- Better error reporting for debugging

### 5. State Management

- Clear the test data tracker after successful cleanup
- Prevents duplicate cleanup attempts

## Key Changes Made

### `src/configloader.rs`:

- `cleanup_test_data()`: Complete rewrite with transaction support and timeout
- Added detailed logging for each cleanup step
- Better error handling and recovery

### `src/main.rs`:

- Modified Windows signal handler to stop server before cleanup
- Modified Unix signal handler with the same improvement
- Added grace period for active requests

## Testing

Created `test_cleanup.ps1` script to verify the fix works correctly by:

1. Starting the application
2. Waiting for initialization
3. Sending termination signal
4. Verifying cleanup completes within timeout

## Benefits

- ✅ No more hanging during shutdown
- ✅ Atomic cleanup operations (all-or-nothing)
- ✅ Timeout protection prevents indefinite hangs
- ✅ Better error reporting and debugging
- ✅ Graceful handling of active requests during shutdown
- ✅ More reliable testing environment

## Usage

The fix is automatically active when `TESTING_MODE=true` is set in the environment. No additional configuration required.
